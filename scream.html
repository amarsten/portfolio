<p>There are two elements of CMU culture that unite every student on campus: stress and bagpipes. At the CMU Screaming Booth, students can scream out their frustrations about work and school. When they're finished the sound is converted into the famous bagpipe tune "Scotland the Brave".

<p>The vocal samples are recorded and then pitch modulated using a Max patch</p>
