       <h1>Destination Constellation</h1>
       <p>For the Build18 hackathon, our team brought to life a pop up coffee shop concept in collaboration with Constellation Coffee. <i>Destination Constellation</i> creates a unique and branded experience for every customer. We took home the Sponsor's Choice Award and a $500 Innovation Award from Lockheed Martin.

       <p>At <i>Destination Constellation</i>, when customers order their pour over coffee, they give their name and answer a few personality questions in our store front app. While they wait, they watch our CNC robot draw a custom design onto their cup. The cup now contains directions and a map to a unique location in Pittsburgh, in the form of a constellation. The customer leaves with a unique artifact to remember their experience by and a place to journey with coffee in hand.
       </p>

       <p>For this concept, we were inspired by the role that Constellation Coffee plays in the community. Constellation is nestled in-between many Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and has an important role as a gathering place to share culture, events and discoveries. The coffee cups represent the role of the coffee shop in the community. We also moved by the reluctance of many CMU students to explore beyond campus. Our team believes that Pittsburgh has more to offer than they might realize.
