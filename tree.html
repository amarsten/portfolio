	<p>Tree of Light is a interactive touch sculpture that creates an emotional experience. A handmade touch sensor and audio and visual actuators create something that is more than the sum of it's technological parts. The project won the First Penguin award at the 2015 CMU Build18 hardware hackathon. From January-August 2015, the sculpture was installed at Alphalab Gear, a startup incubator in East Liberty, Pittsburgh.

	<p>Using Disney's touch and gesture sensing technology,<a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/touche-touch-and-gesture-sensing-for-the-real-world/" style="color: gray;">Touche</a>, the team built an abstracted model tree wrapped in tin foil that could detect and differentiate 0, 1, or 2 touches.

	<p>Based on those touch events, OSC messages were passed between Processing and a ChucK script to generate real time audio. The neutral state of the audio is a randomized melodic line. Chord tones would be layered over the melody when a touch was detected. Single touches are more likely to produce darker tonalities, while two touches would produce blefter tonalities to promote a feeling of cooperation. The chords were produced using a four voice "chorus" of unit generators.

	<p>Now, the lights live on as dancefloor lighting. MaxMSP listens to music, filters the audio, and sends serial messages to sync the lights to the beat. The incandescent bulbs give a unique effect.
